A sketch of network request forwarder where an end-user would write her server program,and run it on her computer, perhaps using the local devices such as the camera, mic, etc.  Typically the computer is behind a firewall and not publicly reachable; but by using a TCP Gender Changer, the user can register her server at a public network forwarder without uploading data or code to the forwarder, and clients can access to the server through the forwarder.
